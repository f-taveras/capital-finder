## Introduction

This API takes the name of a country as input and returns its capital. It's built using Python and queries the REST Countries API.   


## Usage

To use the API, send a GET request with the country's name as a parameter. Below are example URLs for using the API:

### Example URLs:
__Locally:__
```
http://localhost:8080/?country=Chile
http://localhost:8080/?country=France
```
__Deployed Function:__
```
https://serverless-livid-eight.vercel.app/api/atlas?/country=Chile
https://serverless-livid-eight.vercel.app/api/atlas?/country=France
```
These URLs will return the capital of the specified country in the format: "The capital of [Country] is [Capital]."
